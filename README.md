### Note

The commands below are meant to be run in a terminal; which should be easy enough to access if you're using a mac or a linux distribution. Using Windows will be a little trickier. You'll have to install a terminal-like program.
The [Windows installer of Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) comes with a terminal called git-bash. This should be enough to run these commands though you'll have to do some configuring so that the terminal is able to find the `node` program.

##### Alternatives:
* Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/), another terminal like environment for windows.
* Install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download), a linux distribution. Linux distributions are very programmer friendly and access to the terminal should be straightforward. You can choose to install it alongside you current operating system. 
* Install [Ubuntu] in a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), a choice for users who prefer not to dual boot OS.
* Get a [mac](http://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-air/).

### First Run

If this is your first run of the server, we have to make sure the dependencies are installed:

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)! This will come with an executable called `npm` (Node Package Manager) that we'll use to install the dependencies.
2. Install `node-supervisor` with the command `npm install -g supervisor`. This supervisor app will automatically restart the server whenever a file in the project changes. Makes developping a little smoother.
3. If you're on Windows, install [MSYS](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe) to a path without spaces. MSYS provides some unix tools like *make* and *bash*, which make development much easier. Make sure the MSYS tools are in your PATH. MSYS tools work with git.
4. Make sure you're in the same directory as `packages.json` and run the command `npm install`. This will install dependencies like express (our webserver), jade (an html template language), etc. into our project in the node_modules folder.

### Start App

To start the server run the command
`make go`

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the app.
See the `Makefile` to add more targets as you see fit.

##### Errors:

* If a "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory" is encountered, try the command "ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node"

### Directory Structure

This should give an idea of how the code is structured.

* `app.js / app.coffee`
  This file is where the application starts. It's at the root of the project. It's mostly generated by express but you can adjust it. I rewrote app.js in coffeescript which is why there's an app.coffee. 
* `views/`
  This folder is where templates (html files) for pages should go. Express uses an HTML template language called Jade (jade-lang.org) which makes it easier to write HTML.
* `routes/`
  This folder holds code that handles HTTP requests (like GET and POST) that the server receives. For example if I'm in a browser and I'm on the website for our app and I wanna go to `www.oursite.com/home/`, the code that defines what's supposed to happen should be in this folder. `home/` is called a *route*
* `services/`
  Code in here is meant to run on the server. It's where any application-specific logic should go, like primer calculations, xml parsing, melting temperature calculations, etc. Code in this folder is **not** sent to the client's browser. Most probably the code in here is used by the `route` handlers in the `routes/` directory.
* `assets/`
  This folder holds files (like images, css stylesheets, and javascript files) that get sent to the client's browser. You can reference these files in the jade templates from the `views/` folder.
